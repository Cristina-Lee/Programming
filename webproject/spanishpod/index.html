                <div class="reason-1">
                    <div class="reason-title">Short Audio & Video Lessons for Fast and Easy Learning</div>
                    <p class="reason-text">Want to start speaking Spanish from your first lesson? You will! Our lessons take you by the hand and guide you through real Spanish conversations. Our teachers slow down and explain every word and phrase. Just imagine... you’ll finally understand every Spanish word you hear. Learning for travel or love? Want to focus on reading, writing, grammar or culture? You get lessons based on your goals and needs.</p>

                    <div class="reason-title">Study Tools for Rapid Learning</div>
                    <p class="reason-text">Worried you won’t remember the words? You get the word lists, slideshows and flashcards that re-quiz you on words so you never forget them. Worried you won’t “understand” native conversations? You get slowed down audio and line-by-line breakdowns so you pick up every word. What about pronunciation? You can practice and compare yourself with natives with voice-recording tools. And that’s just a small taste of what you’re about to unlock!</p>
